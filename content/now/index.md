## I'm currently looking for work. If you know anyone hiring a stellar Full Stack Software Engineer, let me know!

In the meantime, I'm working on various personal projects, especially getting my website back in order.
I also run about 500sqft of garden in the summer, as well as some fishing, hiking, and whittling.
