# prairie

A couple of months ago I got interested in [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator built with [rust](https://rust-lang.org/).
<!-- more -->
I did some experimenting with it and considered using it for a personal project I had been working on at the time, exploring the various themes the [zola community](https://www.getzola.org/themes/) has to offer.
After much deliberation, I settled on [Papaya](https://github.com/justint/papaya), a great theme that I felt met my need for a smart, simple UI.
The creator of papaya, [Justin Tennant](https://justintennant.me/), mentions in his [writeup on papaya](https://justintennant.me/projects/papaya/) that he was interested in using the [Lunaria Design](https://lunaria.design/) color palletes but strayed away from it.
Prairie started out as basically that: Papaya in Lunaria colors. 

Eventually, the project I had started prairie for was abandoned. Seeing prairie as being a separate project of its own, I decided to keep it around, thinking I might use it again on some other project.
As a living project
