<p>Calgary isn't known for corn. In fact most people living in Calgary don't think the climate can even support a strong corn harvest.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>The good news is that it isn't true. We can absolutely grow corn in our climate. It only requires us to pay attention to its needs.
Calgary (and most of Alberta generally) is known (at least, locally) for its cattle industry. We grow a lot of beef on lands that once sustained many billions of pounds of bison.
Estimates tend to point to there being approximately as many head of cattle in this province as people; something like 5 million.
But gardeners tend not to know what farmers here have known for a long while: much of this herd is fed by corn.</p>
<p>Corn is one of the highest yielding crops to grow. Think about it: for every single kernel you place in the ground in spring, you get something like a 600 kernel return on the cob.
Perhaps more or less depending on the variety, but a well-grown corn plant will easily put out a ~500x return, pushing up to over 1000x if you get a good second ear.
Not bad for a seedy investment!</p>
<p>Farmers know what gardeners don't: corn craves heat, and you can measure exactly how much heat any one variety needs and compare that against <a rel="external" href="https://climateatlas.ca/map/canada/chu_baseline#z=7&amp;lat=51.36&amp;lng=-111.17&amp;city=454">your climate's averages</a> to check if it's a good idea to plant that variety.
On commercial farms where failure is felt by the wallet, I doubt anyone plants a corn variety they don't know the SHU of. In gardens, especially where the garden is grown for fun and not profit or sustenance, I doubt anyone has ever measured the SHU of 90% of the most common varieties. It's certainly an uncommon advertisement.
You might know how many days to maturity your seed is, but if the seed came from a big box store or even most of the major garden seed companies, that measurement was almost certainly not taken anywhere near your garden. How do you know how your garden's climate will suffice?</p>
<p>In 2025, I grew a corn advertised as 78 days to maturity. From transplant, it took exactly 100 days to 50% maturity in my garden. Tack on another 10 days if you want to account from when I planted the seed in flats.
Clearly, the field they measured the rate of maturation in was warmer than my community garden plot.</p>
